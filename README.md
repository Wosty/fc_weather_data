# Fort Collins Weather Analyzer - Find your perfect date!

## Summary
Given a set of "factors of enjoyment" with set preferences, the WeatherAnalyzer will provide the "perfect date" based on historical data. 

### Default Behavior
If no preferences are set, the ideal will be set to the average daytime value and the tolerance will be set to half the average standard deviation.
If no factors are set, it will return December 31 as your perfect date with a 100% chance.

### Caveats
This is only a project made for fun and does make any predictions about the weather.

## Usage
There is a demo.py that shows a very simple example. The program handles most of the operations automatically upon initialization.
